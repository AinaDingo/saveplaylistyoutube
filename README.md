## Getting Started

First, install pytube:

```bash
pip install pytube
```

You can either clone the public repository:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/pytube/pytube.git
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Python package, or install it into your site-packages by running:
```bash
cd pytube
python -m pip install .
```
